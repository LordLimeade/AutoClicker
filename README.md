This is an Auto Clicker program that I developed to click the mouse based on user settings.

The three modes of use are as follows:
    *Unitl Stopped: the program will send click events until a button is pressed or the command key is pressed.
    *While pressed: the program will send click events while the command key is pressed.
    *Set amount: the program will send a predetermined amount of click events and then stop.
    
The program is set up as a Windows Form C# project and tracks the milliseconds between each click and the amount of clicks to send (if Set amount is the chosen mode) as user inputs
The clicking begins after 5 seconds once a mode is chosen and the necessary inputs have been obtained.


I built this projects as a kind of capstone for my software development degree. When I originally wanted to build it after about a year I didn't know enough to complete the project.
